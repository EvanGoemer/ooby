# OOBY: s&box grappling hook game
This is a basic grappling hook s&box project that I am going to make into a full game eventualy

If you want to use the grappling hook in another game of yours feel free to seal the code and use this project as a base so you know how to configure the objects

## WARNING
There is no networking and will fail with multible players BUT i do plan on fixing that at a later point.
